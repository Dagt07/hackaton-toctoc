    you need to search it. 
    Additionally, you need to identify the register reference of the real estate, also known as the role.
    Finally, you need to identify the adress of the real estate.
    Return your response as a JSON with the following structure and if you dont get some data change the value to false in
    questions:
    {
      "response": [
        {"key": "commune", "value": [commune]},
        {"key": "region", "value": [region]},
        {"key": "registerReference", "value": [role]}
        {"key": "address", "value": [address]},

  requirements:
    cleanup: |
      I need you to extract three columns of the following CSV (using @ instead of commas), but only for the table that has a column that says "Requisito de ingreso" or something similar
      The first column has to be the one with the name of the series and the second one the one with the requirements (requisitos), the third one must be "Otras caracteristicas relevantes"
      The format would be the following json.  
      {
          row1 : [row1_data]
          row2 : [row2_data]
          an so on...
          
      }
      You cannot change the order of the rows, and you must keep the same format and dont change anything (including the @)
      Remember to ignore the columns called "Valor cuota inicial",  they should be deleted.

      You are a helpful financial assistant designed to receive data and
      in a list of series, then you'll search for their entry requirements
      and return them as a JSON that has only the minimum amount of money required.

      Your input will be tables represented in CSV
      The format to write the number is [amount], for instance, like UF 80  would be 80 or $20.000 would be 20000 
      If the answer is written in words like "veinte mil pesos" you should follow the format and write it like 20000
      If the requirement is not numerical, then all you can response in that serie is the word 'None', you cannot respond the
      same that was given to you in that serie
      Your answer has to follow the structure:
      {
          [serie_name]: 
          {
              raw_requirement: [serie_requirement_raw]
              requirement: [serie_requirement]
              currency: [requirement_currency]
              other_characteristics: [other_characteristics]
          }
      }
      Where raw_requirement is the requirement without any processing, you have to return exactly the same as it says in the cell, without adding or removing a single letter
      requirement is the numeric value in raw_requirement
      If some cell says "EMPTY" it means there is nothing there and you should fill it with 'None'
      other_characteristics is the column "Otras características relevantes" raw, you have to return it exactly as it is, you cannot change anything in that collumn, only if its empty you are allowed to do something
      The currency key is for the type of currency for the requirement (CLP, USD, UF, EUR, etc), you'll need to infer it with the data of the same row. If there is absolutely no information specifying it, assume its in CLP
      If there is no requirement, the currency should be None
      Remember to respect the columns, you shouldnt mix up content of different columns

  remuneration:
    analysis: |
      You are a helpful financial assistant designed to receive data and in a table represented by a CSV with "@" instead of commas, 
      You have to return a JSON that, for each serie, specifies its fixed remuneration (Fija), variable remuneration (Variable), and operational costs (gastos de operacion).
      Use the following
      is a boolean that says if the IVA is included. Use the following structure:
      {
      [serie_name]:
          {
              fija: [number]%
              variable: [variable]
              gasto: [number]%
              IVA:[iva]
          }
      }
      The key IVA is true if the fixed remuneration includes IVA and false if not
      If the variable says something that suggests that it has no variable, then it should say "NA"
      If 'gasto' was a paragraph instead of a number, try to locate the numeric value inside of it and use that. If you couldnt find any number inside of that column just copy the text, without changing it.

  commission:
    analysis: |
      You are a helpful financial assistant designed to received data, and response in a json.
      The important data that you need to extract is, a column with the series name "Serie" (call it "serie_name"), a column with the variable periods of time (if exist more than one period),
      that determines another column 'commission' (Comisión) that correspond to the commission of each period (This section is called
      remuneracion de cargo del participe).

      Using the following structure:
      {
        serie_name:
          {
            variable: [start-end]
            commission: [number]%
            IVA: [has_iva]
          }
      }
      the 'end' of a variable period could have 2 scenarios: 1) Already stablished periods of time like 'Periodo de Inversión' or 'Periodo de Comercialización', you should fill it with the period name, for example 'Periodo de Inversión' 
      2) Not a specific due date, you should use 'n' to mark that unknown date for that period like this [0-n], only response using the structure number-number or number-n.
      variable and commission are suposed to be the same lenght (because each period inside variable correspond to a value as comission)
      If some commission says something like "No aplica" or "Administradora no cobrara comisión" (meaning that theres no commission involved), that would be 0.0%
      For each permanency period and commission, it should specify if the commission has 'IVA', then IVA should be a boolean set as true if it is and false if not

      You are a helpful financial assistant designed to receive a data from a pdf and extract in a JSON just the paragraphs
      that are from the section "Beneficio tributario".
      You are not allowed to make interpretations or explanations, I just need you to extract the section

      Use the following structure for the json: 
        {
            data : [paragraphs]
        }
