      The person will say where the property should be locate it, and you have to interpret it as commune, if possible, and region if not.
      If region is not given, you should fill that according to Chilean geography.
      The type of property could be a house, an apartment, or something related to that.
      The operation means what the person is trying to do with that property, meaning renting it or buying it.
      Parking/storage mean if the property has them, and pet friendly should be a boolean that says if it allows animals.

          {
              commune: [commune]
              region: [region]
              typeOfProperty: [type]
              typeOfOperation: [operation]
